## 1. Consider a RISC processor with the five pipeline stages:
### (2p) What is meant by a pipeline stall?
### Answer:
When there is a dependence of output from one instruction to another, the newer instruction cannot execute on the clock cycle that it wishes and has to wait for the calculation of the previous.
### (4p) In the following program:
```
add r1,r2,r3 // r1 = r2 + r3
sub r4,r1,r2 // r4 = r1 - r2
```
there is a dependence from hte add to the sub instrcuton. Does this lead to a pipeline stall?
Why or why not? If there is a pipeline stall, could an optimizing compiler have avoided it, and in that case how? Explain what to do with the code (if anything) but not the algorithm for doing it.

### Answer:
There is a true dependence, the sub instruction wants to use the r1 register that is calculated in the `add` instruction. Since true dependencies cannot be avoided the pipeline will stall. This could have been avoided since the second instruction `sub r4, r1, r2` is the same value that is already stored in `r3` and the instruction could be optimized away or changed to the equivalent of `sub r4, r3, 0`.

### (4p) In the following program:
```
load r1,r2,r3 // r1 = MEMORY[r2 + r3]
sub r4,r1,r2
add r5,r2,r3
```
There is also a dependence, from the load to the sub instruction. Does this lead to a pipeline stall? Why or why not? If there is a pipeline stall, could an optimizing compiler have avoided it, and in that case how? Explain what to do with the code (if anything) but not the algorithm for doing it.
### Answer:
There is a true dependence between the `load` and `sub` instructions. `sub` needs to use `r1` which is calculated in `load`. Since `load` instructions can take a long time the stall will be substantial. However the third instruction is not dependant on any of the other instructions and could have been reordered to execute before the sub instruction, leading to a smaller pipeline stall.


### (3p) In the RISC processor in question on one, there is both an instruction cache and a data cache. Why is that a good idea? What would happend if the processor only has one cache?
### Answer:
Having one cache for each means that we can access both caches concurrently. Giving better performance compared to having only one cache. There is also the risk of instruction addresses replacing data addresses and vice versa in a single cache. (?)

## 3. (3p) What does cache associativity mean?
### Answer:
The policy for how addresses are mapped to cache lines. There are three different cache associativites.
+ Fully associative - High cache hit ratio, high hardware costs, address can be mapped anywhere.
+ Direct mapped - Uses a function (kind of like a hash table) to map the address to a specific place in the cache, low hardware costs, higher chance of addresses pushing eachother out of the cache
+ N-way associative - Combination of the two, the function maps to a set instead, which the the N comparators (hardware) then checks all the lines in the set concurrently for available space.


## 4. (4p) What does cache block size mean? What happens if the size is too small or too large? What is a reasonable size?
### Answer:
The cache block represent the amount of data we read into the cache when a cache miss occurs. If the size to small we cannot exploit spatial locality, if the size is to large we instead load unnesseray data into the cache and pollute the cache. A reasonable size is 32, 64, or 128 bytes.

## 6. (10p) Write a function `int count (uint64_t a)` which counts the number of bits with vale one in a variable. Your function should be fast as possible and and summe your computer has a lot of RAM memory such as 64GB. For instance, `count(5) = 2`

```c
int count(uint64_t a)
{
    // On GCC
    return _builtin_popcountll(a);
}

```

##7. (10p) How would you rewrite thhe following loop to increast preforamnce on the assumption that the input file is huge encoded in English text in ASCII.
 The function `getchar` reads the next characther of input and `EOF` is a macro which stands for end of file.
```c
int c;

while((c = getchar()) != EOF)
    if(c == '\n')
        X;
    else if(c == ' ')
        y;
    else
        Z;
```

### Answer:
```c
int c;
while(1) {
    c = getchar();
    if (c > ' ') // most likely
        Z;
    else if ( c == ' ')  // second most likely
        Y;
    else if (c == '\n') // third most likely
        X;
    else if (c == EOF) // happens once
        break;
    else 
       Z;
}
```
