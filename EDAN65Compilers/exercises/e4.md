## 1
Suppose there is a nonterminal stmt for statements. Construct an EBNF grammar
for a sequence of
a) zero of more statements, with a semicolon after each statement.
b) one ore more statements, with a semicolon between statements.
c) zero o more statemnets, witha semiclon between statements.

###A:
a):
```
StmtList -> (stmt ";")* // stmt followed by ";" repeating 0 - * times.
```

b):
```
StmtList -> stmt (";" stmt)* // stmt followed by any number of repeating ; and stmt
```
c):
```
StmtList -> [stmt (";" stmt)*] // Optional
```


## 2 
Translate the previous grammars to canonical form
### A:
a):
```
StmtList -> stmt ";" StmtList
StmtList -> epsilon
```
b):
```
StmtList -> stmt moreStmts 
moreStmts -> ";" stmt moreStmts 
moreStmts -> epsilon
```

b):
```
StmtList -> stmt moreStmts 
StmtList -> epsilon
moreStmts -> ";" stmt moreStmts 
moreStmts -> epsilon
```


## 3

The following grammar generates a language on the alphabet { "(", ")" }.
```
S -> "(" S ")"
S -> S S
S -> "(" ")"
```
a) Which stirngs with length 6 belong to the language
b) The grammar is ambiguous. Which is the shortest string in the language with at least two parse trees?

### A:
a):
((()))
(())()
()(())
()()()
(()())

b):
()()()

## 4
The following grammar is ambiguous. Construct an unambiguous grammar accepting the same language.
```
S -> "(" S ")"
S -> S S
S -> epsilon 
```

A:

```
S -> "(" S ")" S
S -> epsilon
```


## 5
The following grammar for logical expressions is ambiguous.
```
E -> "!" E
E -> E "&&" E
E -> E "||" E
E -> ID
```

Assume that `!` has higher precedence thatn `&&` which in turn precedes over `||`. Construct an unambiguous EBNF grammar that respects the precedences describing the same language.

A:

Approach start with lowest prio as E. And work upwards. This will ensure that the higher precedences will be evaluated first.
```
E -> Andable ( "||" Andable)* 
Andable -> Orable ("&&" Orable)*
Orable -> "!" Orable | ID
```


## 6
Construct a canonical grammar that is equivalent to the following EBNF rule.
`CallStmt -> ID "(" (epsilon | Expr ( "," Expr) *) ")"

A:
```
CallStmt -> ID "(" Args ")"
Args -> epsilon // Args can be empty
Args -> Expr ExprList // Args needs to have atleast one expr
ExprList -> "," Expr ExprList // If there are following exprs they need a "," and atleast another expr
ExprList -> espilon // ExprList can be empty
```

## 7
Every language that is described by a regex can be described by **right regular grammar**, whera all productions have on of the forms
```
A -> a B
A -> a
A -> epsilon
```
where A and B are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Note that right recursion is allowed, but not left recursion.
Construct a right regular grammar for the language described by the regular expression:
```(a* b) | (b a*)```
Is it possible to do this withour using productions on the form `A -> a`?

A: 
```
S -> "a" B
S -> "b" A
A -> "a" A
A -> epsilon
B -> "a" B
B -> "b" C
C -> epsilon
```
a* b:
+ "ab" -> S -> A -> "a" B == "a" "b" C == "a""b""epsilon"
+ "aaaab" -> S -> "a" A -> "a" "a" A -> "a" "a" "a" A -> "a" "a" "a" "a" B -> "a" "a" "a" "a" "b" C -> "a" "a" "a" "a" "b" epsilon
b a*:
+ "b" -> S -> "b" A -> "b" epsilon
+ "baaa" -> S -> "b" A -> "ba" A -> "baa" A -> "baaa" A -> "baaa" epsilon


## 8
Suppose you would like to write a parser that can parse basc regex over the alphabet {"a", "b"}. Some short string in this language are "a", "b", "a*", "ab", "(abb)*", "(a|b)".
a) What is the alphabet of this regular expression language?
b) Constuct an EBNF grammar for this langauge, and that respects the normal precedences of the regex operators.

### A:

a) {"a", "b", "*", "|", "(", ")"}


b)

expr -> term ("|" term)*
term -> factor ("*" factor)*
factor -> "a" | "b" | factor "*" | "(" expr ")"
